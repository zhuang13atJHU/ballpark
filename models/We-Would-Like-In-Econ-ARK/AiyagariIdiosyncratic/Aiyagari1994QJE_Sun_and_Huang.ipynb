    "### Paper's Goals \n",
    "* To provide an exposition of models whose aggregate behavior is the result of market interaction among a large number of agents subject to idiosyncratic shocks. \n",
    "> * This class of models contrasts with representative agent models where individual dynamics and uncertainty coincide with aggregate dynamics and uncertainty. <br/>\n",
    "> * This exposition is built around the standard growth model of Brock and Mirman(1972) modified to include a role for uninsured idiosyncratic risk and borrowing constraint.\n",
    "* To use such a model to study the quantitative importance of individual risk for aggregate saving. <br/>\n",

    "* The Aiyagari model originates from Bewley model and a subsequent literature Zeldes (1989), Deaton (1991), Carroll (1992), and puts these kinds of models into a general equilibrium context. These models all share the same key components as mentioned in the previous part. And they are used to study the following topics:\n",
    "> * How much of observed wealth inequality does a particular choice of uninsurable idiosyncratic income uncertainty explain? <br/>\n",

    "## Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Saving\n",
    "* The differences between the saving rates with an without insurance are quite small for moderate and empirically plausible values of $\\sigma$, $\\rho$, and $\\mu$. However for high values of $\\sigma$, $\\rho$, and $\\mu$, the presence of idiosyncratic risk can raise the saving rate quite significantly. \n",
    "<img src='Table2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variabilities \n",
    "* Consumption varies about 50-70 percent as much as income. Saving and assets are much more volatile than income: Saving varies about three times as much as income, and assets vary about twice as much as income. \n",
    "* Risk aversion tends to reduce the variabilities of all these variabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Asset Trading\n",
    "* If $\\mu=3$,$\\sigma=4$ and $\\rho=0.6$, then, by optimally accumulating and depleting assets, consumption variability is cut in half, yielding a welfare benefit of about 14 percent of per capita consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Section Distributions and Inequality Measures\n",
    "* Since long-run distrubutions for an individual coincide with cross-section distrbutions for the population, results for variabilities of individual consumption, income, and assets have immediate implications for cross-section distributions. \n",
    "* There is much less dispersion across households in consumption compared with income and much greater dispersion in wealth compared with income. \n",
    "* Skewness coefficients reveal another aspect of inequality. All of the cross-section distributions are positively skewed (median$<$mean). However, the degree of skewness is less than in the data. "

    "## Conclusions and Comments\n",
    "The Aiyagari model extends the Bewley model to a context with a production sector. Deviating from the representative agent model in which complete market is implicitly assumed, it tries to study the aggregate saving behavior of the economy with the agents facing a particular kind of uninsured idiosyncratic risk. With an empirically plausible set of parameters, it finds that the aggregate saving rate does increase compared to the case with a complete market, however, the change here caused by the precautionary saving motive is mild. Also, the results of the model qualitatively match the real data in terms of the ranking of the fluctuations of some economic variables. However, in terms of approaching the real inequalities of income and wealth shown by the data, the model does not perform very well. Also, in this model, the joint distribution of income and wealth is not treated as a state variable, which neglects the distribution effect Krusell and Smith(1998) try to address."
